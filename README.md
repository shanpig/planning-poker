# üÉè Pocket Planning Poker

Planning poker everywhere - this one is a small and concise one.

- We don't need to host it on cloud; it can be run locally with ease.
- We don't need to sign in; planning normally happens within team members.
- We don't need to record past planning data; planning is ephemeral.

Planning Poker is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, commonly used in agile development.
